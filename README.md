# IDS_ML
This research presents an optimized machine learning framework using a hybrid hierarchical approach for accurate and efficient detection of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. By combining multiple ML techniques, the model enhances detection speed, reduces false positives, and improves overall cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
