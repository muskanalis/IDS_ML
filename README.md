# IDS_ML
This research presents an optimized machine learning framework using a hybrid hierarchical approach for accurate and efficient detection of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. By combining multiple ML techniques, the model enhances detection speed, reduces false positives, and improves overall cybersecurity defense mechanisms.

Data privacy is essential in the financial sector to protect client’s sensitive information, prevent financial fraud, ensure regulatory compliance, and safeguard intellectual property. It has become
a challenging task due to the increase in usage of the internet and digital transactions. Hence, I worked on the project- Hybrid ML Framework for DDoS Detection project. It presents a hierarchical ML-based hyperparameter-optimization approach for classifying intrusions in a network.

This project is related to DDoS Attacks to Current Indian Cyber Affairs:
India, in 2024–2025, has seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that disrupted government portals, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure services. Your project, which proposes a hierarchical machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS), is highly relevant to these real-time national concerns.

Recent Real-World Incidents in India:
January 2024 – AIIMS & Other Healthcare Attacks:
AIIMS Delhi and other Indian healthcare organizations suffered DDoS and ransomware attacks, causing days of service disruption. These systems handle critical patient data, and your ML-based IDS could help in early detection of such anomalies.

March 2024 – Maharashtra State Cyber Cell Alert:
Reports from CERT-In and Maharashtra Cyber Cell flagged a spike in DDoS attacks on banking servers, slowing down transaction services across major banks. These were likely "test floods" from botnets across borders, trying to overload systems — your LGBM-based detection model can be integrated into firewalls and server monitoring tools for real-time alerting.

2024–2025 – Attacks on Indian Government Portals:
Multiple government sites (especially defence-related domains) experienced multi-vector DDoS attacks, suspected to be state-sponsored. These highlight the urgent need for adaptive models, like yours with hyperparameter-tuned hierarchical ML, to dynamically evolve against new intrusion techniques.


I have learned these skills throughout the project- The LASSO
approach was used for feature selection, given as input to the hierarchical ML algorithms: XGboost, LGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). I also came across Machine learning, hyperparameter optimization, classification, cyberattacks, intrusion detection.
